to-do list:

 - npcs: silly guys that will run around location, and some unique ones
 - basic location: either big location or few scenes where you can enter rooms and etc
 - progression?: shoot to earn points, buy pew-pews for points!
 - skills: basic character can get boring!
 - get attention of someone who can draw so game doesnt looks like ass????
 - maybe character-difficulty selection
